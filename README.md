# itunes-to-android
Java program that syncs your iTunes playlists to your Android device over USB. Requires ADB: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html

Program.jar is the only file here you need to download to make it work. You can rename it to whatever you want. The source is included here for those interested.

I know this program might be redundant for some, as most Android devices already have ways to do this. However, mine (Galaxy S6) does not. I did not trust any of the results on Google that claimed to be able to do this, so I made my own.

Do not bother with this yet. I am uploading it here so I can keep track of it. Right now it literally only works for me, as the directory paths to the necessary files are hard-coded in the source. I guess you could download the source and tweak it yourself if you wanted to, but I doubt anyone reading this has any interest in that.
